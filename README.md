# geometric-sampling-cpp
C++ implementation of geometric random sampling for 1D, 2D, and 3D spaces. Includes random generation inside and on shapes (circle, disk, sphere, ball, cube) and random bright color generation in HSV space. Educational project demonstrating probabilistic geometry and random number distributions.
